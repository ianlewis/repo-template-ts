Repository template for TypeScript repositories under `github.com/ianlewis`.

This repository template is maintained for use in repositories under
`github.com/ianlewis`. However, it can be used as a general purpose TypeScript
repository starter template.

This repository is set up to make use of ESM modules and makes use of
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests.

## Goals

### Repository quality

A set of [formatters and linters](#formatting-and-linting) are maintained to
maintain repository code and configuration quality through PR checks.

### Consistency & Reproducibility

Repositories created by this template should work as consistently as possible by
minimizing issues due to conflicting installed package versions. Running
commands and tools locally should have the same result between different local
development machines and CI. Recommended language runtime versions are set via
their respective ecosystem tooling.

This template strives to minimize outside dependencies on tools and
configuration requiring only a [minimal set](#requirements) of Unix userspace
tools and language runtimes to work. Dependencies are downloaded and stored
locally inside the project directory so they don't conflict with globally
installed package versions.

### Security

In general, dependencies for tools and GitHub Actions are pinned to improved
overall project supply-chain security.

External dependencies on GitHub actions are limited to trusted actions with
good security practices (e.g. official GitHub-owned actions) to minimize
exposure to compromise via external repositories.

Versioning of formatting, linting, and other tool dependencies is done via the
`requirements.txt` and `packages.json` where possible. This is so that the
versions can be maintained and updated via dependency automation tooling. This
repository uses [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) because it
allows more flexibility in configuration than Dependabot.

See also [Recommended repository settings](#recommended-repository-settings)
for more recommended security settings.

## Requirements

This repository template is meant to be used on Linux systems. It may still
work on MacOS or Windows given a `bash` environment, but this is not tested.

In general, dependencies on outside tools should be minimized in favor of
including them as project-local dependencies.

The following language runtimes are required. It is recommended to use a tool
that can manage multiple language runtime versions such as
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv),
[`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv),
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), or [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/). This
repository includes `.node-version` and `.python-version` files to specify the
language runtime versions to use for maximum compatibility with these tools.

- [`Node.js`]: Node.js is required to run some linters and formatters.
- [`Python`]: Python is required to run some linters and formatters.

The following tools need to be installed:

- [`git`]: For repository management.
- `awk`, `bash`, `grep`, `head`, `rm`, `sha256sum`, `uname`: Standard
  Unix tools.
- GNU `make`: For running commands.
- `curl`, `tar`, `gzip`: For extracting archives.

The following tools are automatically installed locally to the project and
don't need to be pre-installed:

- [`actionlint`]: For linting GitHub Actions workflows (installed by Aqua in
  `.aqua`).
- [`eslint`]: For linting JavaScript and TypeScript (installed in local
  `node_modules`).
- [`jq`]: For parsing output of some linters (installed by Aqua in `.aqua`).
- [`markdownlint`]: For linting markdown (installed in local `node_modules`).
- [`mbrukman/autogen`]: For adding license headers (vendored in `third_party`).
- [`prettier`]: For formatting markdown and YAML files (installed in local
  `node_modules`).
- [`shellcheck`]: For linting shell code in GitHub Actions workflows (installed
  by Aqua in `.aqua`).
- [`textlint`]: For spelling checks (installed in local `node_modules`).
- [`todos`]: For checking for outstanding TODOs in code (installed by Aqua in
  `.aqua`).
- [`yamllint`]: For linting YAML files (installed in local Python virtualenv
  `.venv`).
- [`zizmor`]: For linting GitHub Actions workflows (installed in local Python
  virtualenv `.venv`).

## Usage

The repository is organized to be as self-contained as possible. Commands are
implemented in the project [Makefile](#makefile).

### Makefile

The `Makefile` is used for running commands, managing files, and maintaining
code quality. It includes a default `help` target that prints all make targets
and their descriptions grouped by function.

```shell
$ make
repo-template-ts Makefile

```

### Formatting and linting

Some `Makefile` targets for basic formatters and linters are included along
with GitHub Actions pre-submits. Where possible, pre-submits use `Makefile`
targets and those targets execute with the same settings as they do when run
locally. This is to give a consistent experience when attempting to reproduce
pre-submit errors.

Versioning of formatting, linting, and other tools are managed as tool
dependencies so they can be more easily maintained.

`Makefile` targets and linter/formatter configuration are designed to respect
`.gitignore` and not cross `git submodule` boundaries. However, you will need
to add files using `git add` for new files before they are picked up.

`Makefile` targets for linters will also produce human-readable output by
default, but will produce errors as [GitHub Actions workflow
commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions)
so they can be easily interpreted when run in Pull-Request [status
checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).

### License headers

The `license-headers` make target will add license headers to files that are
missing it with the Copyright holder set to the current value of `git config
user.name`.

Files are checked for the existence license headers in status checks.

    - [ ] **Standard alert severity level:** Errors and warnings
3. [ ] **Secret protection:**
       Get alerts when secrets are detected in the repository.
4. [ ] **Push protection:**
       Block pushing commits with secrets in them.

## Keeping repositories in sync

You can optionally keep repositories created with the template in sync with
changes to the template. Because repositories created from GitHub templates are
not forks, it is recommended to perform a squash merge to squash the merge as a
commit on your commit history.

```shell
# One time step: Add the repository template as a remote.
git remote add repo-template-ts git@github.com:ianlewis/repo-template-ts.git

# Fetch the latest version of the repo-template-ts.
git fetch repo-template-ts main

# Create a new squash merge commit.
git merge --no-edit --signoff --squash --allow-unrelated-histories --log repo-template-ts/main
```
