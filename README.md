[![tests](https://github.com/ianlewis/repo-template-ts/actions/workflows/pre-submit.units.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ianlewis/repo-template-ts/actions/workflows/pre-submit.units.yml)

Repository template for TypeScript repos under github.com/ianlewis

This repository template is maintained for use in repos under
`github.com/ianlewis`. However, it can be used as a general purpose TypeScript
repository starter template.

## Makefile

The `Makefile` is used for managing files and maintaining code quality. It
includes a default `help` target that prints all make targets and their
descriptions grouped by function.

```shell
repo-template-ts Makefile
Usage: make [COMMAND]

  help                 Shows all targets and help from the Makefile (this message).
Build
  compile              Compile TypeScript.
Tools
  license-headers      Update license headers.
Formatting
  format               Format all files
  md-format            Format Markdown files.
  yaml-format          Format YAML files.
  js-format            Format YAML files.
  ts-format            Format YAML files.
Linters
  lint                 Run all linters.
  actionlint           Runs the actionlint linter.
  zizmor               Runs the zizmor linter.
  markdownlint         Runs the markdownlint linter.
  yamllint             Runs the yamllint linter.
  eslint               Runs eslint.
Maintenance
  clean                Delete temporary files.
```

## Formating and linting

Some `Makefile` targets for basic formatters and linters are included along
with GitHub Actions pre-submits. Versioning of these tools is done via the
`requirements.txt` and `packages.json`. This is so that the versions can be
maintained and updated via `dependabot`-like tooling.

Required runtimes:

- [`Node.js`]: Node.js is required to run some linters and formatters.
- [`Python`]: Python is required to run some linters and formatters.

The following tools need to be installed:

- [`actionlint`]: For linting GitHub Actions workflows.
- [`shellcheck`]: For linting shell code in GitHub Actions workflows.

The following tools are installed locally:

- [`yamllint`]: For YAML (e.g. GitHub Actions workflows; installed in Python virtualenv `.venv`).
- [`prettier`]: For formatting markdown and yaml (installed in local
  `node_modules`).
- [`markdownlint`]: For linting markdown (installed in local `node_modules`).
- [`eslint`]: For linting JavaScript and TypeScript (installed in local `node_modules`).

`Makefile` targets and linter/formatter config are designed to respect
`.gitignore` and not cross `git` submodules boundaries. However, you will need
to add files using `git add` for new files before they are picked up.

`Makefile` targets for linters will also produce human-readable output by
default, but will produce errors as [GitHub Actions workflow
commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/workflow-commands-for-github-actions)
so they can be easily interpreted when run in Pull-Request [status
checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).

## License headers

The `license-headers` make target will add license headers to files that are
missing it with the Copyright holder set to the current value of `git config
user.name`.

Files are checked for the existence license headers in pre-submits.

## Project documentation

This repository template includes stub documentation. Examples of
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` can be found in the
[ianlewis/ianlewis](https://github.com/ianlewis/ianlewis) repository and are
maintained in line with [GitHub recommended community
standards](https://opensource.guide/).

## Security & Dependencies

In general, dependencies for tools and GitHub Actions are pinned to improved
overall project supply-chain security.

External dependencies on GitHub actions are limited to official GitHub-owned
actions to minimize exposure to compromise of external repositories.

## Keeping repositories in sync

You can optionally keep repositories created with the template in sync with
changes to the template. Because repositories created from GitHub templates are
not forks, it is recommended to perform a squash merge to squash the merge as a
commit on your commit history.

```shell
# One time step: Add the repository template as a remote.
git remote add repo-template-ts git@github.com:ianlewis/repo-template-ts.git

# Fetch the latest version of the repo-template-ts.
git fetch repo-template-ts main

# Create a new squash merge commit.
git merge --no-edit --signoff --squash --allow-unrelated-histories --log repo-template-ts/main
```
